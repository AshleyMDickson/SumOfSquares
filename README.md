## Prime Numbers as Sums of squares 

This is hopefully going to be a little programme that tests whether a number can be expressed as a sum of squares.

Ideally in python, but there may be performance issues with larger values.

We might also need to create a prime tester to roll in because we're only interested in prime numbers that can be expressed as sums of squares.

Prime number tester done, and restricted to primes of form 4k+1.
Next need, to implement some logic to test the summation.

I think that's done. 

Next, restrict primes to odd primes only, per Fermat's theorem on Sums of Two Squares.
