## Sums of squares and Primes 

This is hopefully going to be a little programme that tests whether a number can be expressed as a sum of squares.

Ideally in python, but there may be performance issues with larger values.

We might also need to create a prime tester to roll in because we're only interested in prime numbers that can be expressed as sums of squares.
